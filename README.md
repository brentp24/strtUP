### Background
As someone that is very busy, I want an adaptable page that I can customize to meet my needs on the start up of my browser and have that experience carry over to my mobile usage. These needs may include:  
1. Get an inspirational quote
2. See the local weather
3. Restaurants in my area
4. Sports news
5. What is the next holiday coming up
6. Time
7. Find the definition of a word
8. Check the air quality


### Features
strtUP is a dynamic dashboard that allows you to customize your homepage with the use of different tiles. Each tile can contain specialized information about almost any subject area. It is the depth of information accessible by these tiles that makes strtUp a unique dashboard. You have access to  specified information and can readily change out your tiles to show you exactly what you want to see on your screen at start up.
